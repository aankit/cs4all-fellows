# CS Curriculum Track 2017-18

## Kick-off workshop: Day 1

#### Soft-start
- Send an intro to the email if you haven't yet
- Read intro emails
- Read about [Erna Hoover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erna_Schneider_Hoover)
- Tell me about your expecations using the handout that says "As we scale CS4All across the City,..."

#### Understanding concepts and practices
For the next 30 minutes, please analyze this tutorial on React.js, Facebook's front-end rendering engine. Your goal is to find example of the [Concepts + Practice](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10Oa9WgVrHA2TAWbT1b3_25M0VKyXJNUjduT_AhF_FZY) in the tutorial and to record them in the [Blueprint Scavenger Hunt spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wJ8Pg0g8Ch3Vl5KisbfsaBv2zhriZgfWxksKhWoY-pg/copy)

Please share your Blueprint Scavenger Hunt spreadsheet with apatel4@strongschools.nyc.

#### Context
Why are we here? What is CS4ALL? What is the Blueprint?
Who are you? Who am I? 
What is our goal?
What are our challenges?

#### Introduction to Meaningful Units
What is computing good for?
* Scale
    * Size
    * Distribution
* Speed
* Automation

#### Design thinking to find opportunities to integrate CS

Create personas for:
* A teacher at your school who doesn’t currently teach CS
* A student at your school that doesn’t care about CS
* Critique personas using Analyze practice
* Resources

Practical plans for the summer:
* Meetings (in-person, digital, small group, one-on-one)?
* What types of supports can I provide?

Independent work time:
* Read existing units
* Ask questions (listed below)
* Outline units

#### Homework
* Review [Concepts + Practices](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10Oa9WgVrHA2TAWbT1b3_25M0VKyXJNUjduT_AhF_FZY)
* Read [Perspectives](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GlmSupRDHvC4SNI_4TgtxG5gSjlhlxyjvRf2LGB94nY)
* Explore Resources, try to read and watch one thing
* Skim the [Hats] presentation (https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9648298/HATS.pdf) by Martin Bravo
* Identify the artifact that you want students to make & start making it!


## Kick-off workshop: Day 2

#### Soft-start
* Share the perspective(s) you will be working from
* Share an inspiring project
* Share a technical learning goal

#### Context
* [How might I prepare to teach CS?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KB1WaqaNcFBb7ZHv3ABTIKkxCjBEmPHlrWEP5yZdmx8/edit?usp=sharing)
* PD leads workshop July 18-20 @ Downtown Conference Center, 9a-4p
* Time to build a project and document
    - 3 hour long sprints
    - 10 minute demos at the beginning of each sprint
    - 10 minute feedback session at the end of each sprint

#### Build Sprints
Potential demo topics
- Learning different programming languages
- Integrated Development Environments
- Version control with Github
- Documentation with screen capture

#### Reflection
Add discussion questions

#### Homework
* Keep building your project!
* [Read about the Teacher-Learner-Observer model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zNXCm6MDcgqwwT32E56ZrTAvIFi5OW-ev9nE7CPU78M/edit?usp=sharing)

## Kick-off workshop: Day 3

#### Soft-start
* Sign for a demo slot with a post-it
* Keep working on your project + unit

#### Triage
Where is everyone in terms of having something worthwhile to demo that they can actually get useful feedback on?
Keep building...

#### Demos
Using the Teacher-Learner-Observer (TLO) training modality we will workshop our unit ideas, get useful feedback on content, pedagogical strategies, potential extensions, etc.

#### Next steps for Fellowship
Finalize meeting plan
Finalize objectives - dates and deliverables, per session management
